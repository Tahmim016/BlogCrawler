Scraping Amrabondhu blog

Here I have scraped the blog contents from the website [Amrabondhu](https://www.amrabondhu.com/) using scrapy.

It includes:
1. ID (just to number the contents)
2. Title
3. Author
4. Text i.e the whole article
5. URL of the page
6. Published date of the article
7. Accessed time

Also it will save all the html pages and will parse all the next pages.

Requirements:
1. [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) IDE
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.10
3. [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) 2.4.1

These are just my requirements to write and run the script.
